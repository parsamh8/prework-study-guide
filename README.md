# prework-study-guide

A study guide for the University of Toronto pre-work courses before the program begins on September 16, 2024.

## Description

This guide offers an organized and approachable way to get familiar with the key topics you'll encounter early on. I built this project to give learners a practical, hands-on way to explore foundational web development concepts like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Rather than just reading about these technologies, students can interact with real code examples and reinforce their learning by building along with the guide. Through building this project, I improved my own understanding of core web development concepts. I learned how to effectively explain technical subjects in simple terms, how to organize content for ease of learning, and how to create a user-friendly resource that can be referenced at any time. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of Git and the importance of version control in project development.
